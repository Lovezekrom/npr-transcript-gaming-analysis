For my DATA301 project, I wanted to see how the sentiment or language surrounding gaming has
changed in 20 years. My research question was, how has vocabulary used frequently with
gaming evolved after two decades in media? The dataset I used was the NPR Media Dialog
Data. I used the A-Priori algorithm to find the frequent words used in the same sentences as
“gaming.” The intended result was the most frequent words in 1999-2009 and the most
frequent words from 2010-2019. The significance of the result was that it allowed for an
easier comparison of the language surrounding gaming between the years.
